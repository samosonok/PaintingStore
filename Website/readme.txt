TESTING
1. Microsoft Edge
Tested the website functionality by navigating through all the pages and links, including filling out forms and submitting them, scrolling through pages, and accessing the dropdown menus. Encountered one issue with the dropdown menu not displaying properly. It was displaying both ways: block and inline-block.
Solved the issue by inspecting the CSS code and adding new property ul.topnav ul.dropdown li {display:block;}.
